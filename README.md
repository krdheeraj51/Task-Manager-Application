# Task-Manager-Application
You are tasked with building a task manager application using TypeScript. This application allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.
## Requirements:
Data Model: Define TypeScript interfaces/classes to represent tasks. Each task should have properties such as title, description, due date, and status (e.g., "completed", "in progress").

CRUD Operations: Implement functions/methods to perform CRUD operations on tasks:

Create a task
Read all tasks
Read a single task by ID
Update a task
Delete a task
Asynchronous Operations: Use Promises or async/await to handle asynchronous operations when interacting with external data sources (e.g., a mock database or API).

Error Handling: Implement error handling to gracefully handle scenarios such as invalid input, failed operations, or unexpected errors. Use custom error classes/interfaces where appropriate.

Testing: Write unit tests using a testing framework like Jest to ensure the correctness of your functions/methods. Test both the functionality and error-handling logic.

User Interface (Optional): If desired, create a simple command-line interface or web interface to interact with the task manager application. Use TypeScript to handle user input and display task information.
